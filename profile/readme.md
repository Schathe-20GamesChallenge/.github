# :space_invader: 20 Games Challenge - Schathe

Welcome to my game development journey! This project follows the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/), a series of mini-games designed to progressively teach the fundamentals of video game development.

## 📅 Progress

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Game mechanics  
- Code reuse  
- Creating art and sound  
- Advanced controllers  
- Artificial intelligence  
- Level design  

## 💡 Goal

Build 20 games while documenting my learning process, mistakes, and successes. Each game is a step toward mastering game development.
At first, I will try coding in C++ with SFML to learn the basics. Later, when it becomes too difficult with SFML, I will switch to a more suitable engine and start the list again with the easiest games.
